FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation

This is the second version of the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI). It is a major enhancement compared to FMI 1.0, where the FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards have been merged, and many improvements have been incorporated, often due to practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards. New features include: Parameters can be changed during simulation, the complete FMU state can be saved, restored and serialized, directional derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be computed, the structure of the partial derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be given (to support large systems), algebraic loops over FMUs are now supported in all modes (initialization, event, continuous-time) for Model Exchange, allowing for example improved initialization.

Version 2.0 was released on July 25, 2014.
